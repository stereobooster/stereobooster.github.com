Remote work is like asynchronous distibuted calculus. Map/reduce + job queue.

Because team member can be in different places, in different time zones, you need to minify synchronous actions.

You need to use asynchronous messaging: chat.

You need to have a pool of things to do. If you stuck in one place i.e. need response from someone else. You can commit current changes and get to the next thing.

Clean code, tests, comments in code, well documented requirements and business rules are comunication tools. Write once share continiously.

Automate everything. Document if you can't automate. Automate dev environment setup. This make quickstart easy





Use standards. And stardand checking tools.

Share knowledge and best practices.
