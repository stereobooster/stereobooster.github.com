## Rationale

I want to write some stories on software development. They been told 1000 times already. There are comics drawn on this theme like xkcd.com and dilbert.com (don't visit links you will stuck there).

But still Im feel need to write it down. To be aware of this. Maybe come up with something to be able to avoid those situations in the future. Because geting into it again and again makes me feel frustrated.

## Software specifications commonly known as specs

-- Do we have specs for this?
-- Wait are you saying we need specify EVERYTHING the system will do? This is waterfall methodlogy. And we use agile here.

-- Do we have specs for this?
-- It is already implemented in our codebase. Use existing code
