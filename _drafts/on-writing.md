## writing

> `/ˈrʌɪtɪŋ/`
>
> - the activity or skill of writing.
> - the activity or occupation of composing text for publication.

> Writing is a medium of human communication that represents language and emotion through the inscription or recording of signs and symbols. In most languages, writing is a complement to speech or spoken language.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing)

Not everyone who can write is writer. Not everyone who owns camera is photographer. If I would by dantist chair, it won't make me dantist.


## Books

The Elements of Style by William Strunk, Jr. [on Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/37134/37134-h/37134-h.htm), [on crockford](http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/style.html)

## Grammar checkers

- Spell, grammar, style checker.
- Typography checker. With auto-correct option.
- Command line tool with color support.
- Command line tool with interactive mode. It will ask you what to do on every error. And it will be possible to add words to ignore list.
- Command line tool that able to generate report. And exit with error (non zero) code, so it will be possible to detect failure status in command line.
- With per folder/project settings: to ignore words, to ignore style rules, to set default language.
- Ability to integrate with editors using general interface or protocol like [sublime linters](http://www.sublimelinter.com/en/latest/) do.
- Support of markdown

I want basically something like [mdast-lint](https://github.com/wooorm/mdast-lint) or [eslint](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface) or [rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop), but for natural language.
