# RFC stands for Request for Comments.

RFC is a type of publication from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and others.

RFC documents were invented by Steve Crocker in 1969 to help record unofficial notes on the development of ARPANET. RFCs have since become official documents of Internet specifications, communications protocols, procedures, and events. See [RFC 1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1).

Most RFCs use a common set of terms such as "MUST" and "NOT RECOMMENDED" (as defined by [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)), Augmented Backusâ€“Naur Form (ABNF) ([RFC 5234](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234)) as a meta-language, and simple text-based formatting, in order to keep the RFCs consistent and easy to understand.

## Internet Draft
An Internet Draft (I-D) is a document published by the IETF. Often, I-D are intended to be work-in-progress documents for work that is eventually to be published as a RFC. It is considered inappropriate to rely on I-D for reference purposes. I-D citations should indicate the I-D is a work in progress.
