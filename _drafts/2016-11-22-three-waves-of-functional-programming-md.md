title: Three waves of functional programming

## What do they mean by saying functional programming?

If you ask this question, you can get pretty controversial answers. Is it all about higher-order functions? Or something else? Lets explore?

## Lisp or untyped lambda calculus

First functional programming language is Lisp invented by John McCarthy in 1958. It is influenced by notataion of lambda calculus by Alonzo Church. Main features, which makes it functional: higher-order functions, recursion and later tail call optimization. Other fetures: dynamic typing (correspond to untyped lambda calculus), minimal syntax and "everything is" philosophy, macro system that leads to DSLs.

## ML or Hindleyâ€“Milner type system

ML was invented by Robin Milner & others at the University of Edinburgh in 1973. Main features: parametric polymorphism, static typing, type inference, algebraic data types, pattern matching.

## Haskel or monads from category theory

## Erlang or Actor model

## Other

Pure, Immutable, Currying
