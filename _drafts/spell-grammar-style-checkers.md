# Tools

## LanguageTool
[LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/) is an Open Source proof­reading program for English, French, German, Polish, and more than 20 other languages.

Written in **Java**. Has plugins: LibreOffice, OpenOffice, Firefox, Chrome. Has command line version. Can be integrated into other programs. Has online version.

## Retext
[retext](https://github.com/wooorm/retext) is an extensible natural language processor with support for multiple languages. Retext provides a pluggable system for analysing and manipulating natural language in JavaScript. Node and the browser. 100% coverage.

> Rather than being a do-all library for Natural Language Processing (such as
> [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org) or [OpenNLP](https://opennlp.apache.org)),
> **retext** aims to be useful for more practical use cases (such as checking
> for [insensitive words](https://github.com/wooorm/alex) or decoding
> [emoticons](https://github.com/wooorm/retext-emoji)) instead of more academic
> goals (research purposes).
> **retext** is inherently modular—it uses plugins (similar to
> [mdast](https://github.com/wooorm/mdast/) for markdown) instead of providing
> everything out of the box (such as
> [Natural](https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural)). This makes **retext** a
> viable tool for use on the web.

Written in **JavaScript**. Has command line interface.
