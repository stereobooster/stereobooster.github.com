title: Knowledge framework

There are lot of knowledge acumulated by humankind. Each day it becomes harder and harder to manage it, discover it, keep it in up to date state.

## Problem 1: new area

You are get into some kind of knowledge area you haven't been before. You need to learn some new thing. Where will you start? Most likely you will start from search engine (google, duckduckgo etc). It will lead you most likely to wikipedia (there are some issues with wikipedia) or other website. Depending on subject complexity you will find your answer at once (lucky you) or continue research. Continue research means: the first link not sutisfying you will try other website or refine your query and try another site after that or discover some new things that need to be researched in order to understand initial idea (target of research). In that manner you unwinding knowledge from complex concept up-to basic concepts or up-to familiar concepts.

Side note: I'm talking about internet and website research, but the same way this reasoning can be applied to libraries and books. Website not limited to wikipedia or blogs, it also can be online published books or research papers.

This type of research process is hard. New knowledge area can be so big, so newish that it would be hard dive in. On practice this problem solved in two ways: you spend a lot of time to aquire enough experience or knowledge to be able to navigate in given subject freely or you get an expert who will guide you in the new area.

### Time

There is related problem of time consuming dive in: [10,000-Hour Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)). Which states that key to achieving world class expertise in any skill, is, to a large extent, a matter of practicing the correct way, for a total of around 10,000 hours. Later author added:

> Practice isn't a SUFFICIENT condition for success. I could play chess for 100 years and I'll never be a grandmaster. The point is simply that natural ability requires a huge investment of time in order to be made manifest.

There are oposite opinions on this subject:

>There is no doubt that deliberate practice is important, from both a statistical and a theoretical perspective. It is just less important than has been argued. For scientists, the important question now is, what else matters?

Tim Ferris [who showed](http://genius.com/Tim-ferriss-what-about-the-10000-hour-rule-annotated) how in some case those 10,000 (10 years 20 hours a week) can be reduced to 6 monthes. I'm not saying that it is generally possible to reduce every learning process to 6 monthes, but there is some room for improvements in this field.

### Expert

This is actually very old way to deal with the problem. Expert in new area which will guide you though is basically a teacher. This approach goes down to times when knowledge was shared by talks in fireplace in a cave. This is good approach except it has "performance bottleneck" (take into account my IT background):

 - There are less teachers than learners (at least so far).
 - Not all teachers are equally good and to achieve fast result you want the best instructor in the field.
 - You may not have access to best teacher due to financial reasons or due to not knowing language of a techer or due to leaving in other place.
 - It is may be hard to identify who is the best expert in the field.

Tim Ferris also relies on best expert in the field to achieve high speed of learning.

So how would you repeat same experience of guidance by teacher throught the new area.











Other problem is partial knowledge: when you have some knowledge






Humankind advanced in science, acumulated huge amounts of knowledge, though there is no good framework for knowledge distribution and knowledge discovery (or at least I'm not aware of it).

Let's explore what good knowledge framework can look like. What does make kmowledge framework "good"? What is knowledge frameowrk?

Knowledge frameowrk is collection of tools and approaches to explore existing knowledges, verify consisntency and discover new knowledges.

## Current practices

### Culture

Culture, traditions, folklore is one of the first knowledge frameworks.
