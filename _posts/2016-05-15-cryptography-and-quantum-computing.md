While this seems to be not a big deal to factor 15, this is significant breakthrough. This is actual working prototype of quantum computer. It is just matter of time when it will be `production readyâ„¢`.

What does matter is that this `production ready` version of quantum computer would be open-source and affordable for everyone, because otherwise it will become weapon. Trying to protect privacy with classic encryption against quantum computer is like trying to stop hot knife with butter.

Picture bellow shows how technologically advanced conquistadors (wearing armor, using firearms and riding horses) fought with Aztecs
