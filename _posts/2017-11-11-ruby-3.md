title: Ruby 3
---

It just struck me that I thought wrong about what are ruby 3 goals are. So I
want to summarize what Ruby 3 is about in this post for those who misunderstand
it like me.

Ruby 3 has 3 main goals: **Performance**, **Remove limits of GIL**, **Static type checker**.
And one big constraint: compatibility. Matz doesn't want a repetition of  Python
3 situation.

[Ruby 3.0 with Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQko1rnkL7w).


## Performance

This goal also called Ruby 3x3 - it means that bottom line here is to make Ruby
3 at least 3 times faster than Ruby 2. The main bet in this race is on Just In
Time compiler or JIT for short. But also there are other things that can help
with speed

- Generational GC - [done](https://blog.heroku.com/incremental-gc)
- [Make symbols collectible](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/9634)
- frozen string literals, to decrease pressure on GC. See
  [8976](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/8976),
[11473](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11473)
- Ahead of time compiler or for short AOT. I guess
  [bootsnap](https://github.com/Shopify/bootsnap) solves the problem
- Decrease heap fragmentation and improve CoW. A lot of work in this direction
  done by Aaron Patterson. See
[gc-compact](https://github.com/github/ruby/tree/gc-compact),
[tweet](https://twitter.com/tenderlove/status/801578350372265984?lang=en),
[deck](https://speakerdeck.com/tenderlove/building-a-compacting-gc)
- Improve allocator. See [9113](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/9113),
  [scalloc](https://github.com/cksystemsgroup/scalloc)

### JIT

There are a lot of possible candidates here:

- [llrb](https://github.com/k0kubun/llrb)
- [mjit](https://github.com/vnmakarov/ruby/tree/rtl_mjit_branch)
- [rubytruffle](http://chrisseaton.com/rubytruffle/)
- [rubyomr](https://github.com/rubyomr-preview/rubyomr-preview)
- [rujit](https://github.com/imasahiro/rujit)

## Remove limits of GIL

GIL stands for Global Interpreter Lock.
Because of backward compatibility restriction, they do not want to remove GIL
completely. Instead, idea is to introduce new concurrency abstraction which will
overcome GIL limits. This new mechanism is called Guilds. You can read more
about guilds
[here](http://olivierlacan.com/posts/concurrency-in-ruby-3-with-guilds/)

## Static type checker

This is the only goal of Ruby 3, which does not have proposed solution from Ruby
team. The problem is that team wants backward compatibility on one side and does
not want to add heavy type declarations on the other side - because ruby should
be enjoyable language.

Options:
- [steep](https://github.com/soutaro/steep)
- [diamondback-ruby](https://github.com/stereobooster/diamondback-ruby)
- [rdl](https://github.com/plum-umd/rdl) - not sure about this. It is pretty
  confusing from my POW
