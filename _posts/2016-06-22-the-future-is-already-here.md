Examples are countless. Lets explore some.

## African agriculture

Most of African population is farmers and yet one of the biggest problems in Africa is hunger. How is that? This happens because they are using the same primitive tools, methodologies and species, that were used 1000 years ago. Modern methods of farming will produce 5 times more crop on the same area (compared to American farmers).

Proper use of fertilizers, crop rotation, timing and planting techniques can increase crop significantly.

## Laboratory equipment

Capacity of computers (smartphone and other devices) increased much lately. Quality and quantity of sensors on smartphone increased too. [It is allow to do spectrometry with piece of DVD and smartphone](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jywarren/public-lab-diy-spectrometry-kit/description).

Still most of laboratory equipment costs a lot. Example PCR machine can cost up to $10,000, [while you can construct your own for $649](http://openpcr.org/).

[You can buy computer for $9](https://getchip.com/pages/chip). You can construct RepRap printer for $500 (need reference on this).

Production capacities, knowledge, technological level allow to construct cheap accessible laboratory equipment.

## Education

Science reached unbelievable heights nowadays. Even so people still believes in pseudo-science. Some examples:

- [Astrology Debunked - Richard Dawkins in Enemies of Reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlMiKrwCRQ0)
- [Homeopathy - Con or Cure - Richard Dawkins in Enemies of Reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0-NalmRSl8)

It is failure of educational systems, which allows such things to be tolerated or ignored. They do not teach people to think skeptically.

- [Logical fallacyis](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/)
- [Skeptic's Dictionary](http://www.skepdic.com/)
- [Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com/) is an online community for people who want to apply the discovery of biases like the conjunction fallacy, the affect heuristic, and scope insensitivity in order to improve their own thinking.

This is just a tip of iceberg. They even fail in teaching real science. See [this 1 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM630Z8lho8) to get the idea.

[See also this video from RSA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDZFcDGpL4U) on why educational paradigms need to be changed.

On the other side [there are tons of online courses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCourseWare) from top universities. You can get best education in front of you screen at home.
