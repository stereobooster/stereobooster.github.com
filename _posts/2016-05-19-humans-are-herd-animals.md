> Herd behavior describes how individuals in a group can act collectively without centralized direction. The term can refer to the behavior of animals in herds, packs, bird flocks, fish schools and so on, as well as the behavior of **humans** in demonstrations, riots and general strikes, sporting events, religious gatherings, episodes of mob violence and **everyday decision-making, judgment and opinion-forming**.

Herd behavior was a good strategy at some point of evolution.

But it doesn't seem to be so good, when you can destroy planet with push of a button.

When you can destroy life on earth by deforestation, by increased production of carbon dioxide, by plastic pollution, by destroying ozone layer.

## I think this all happens because of lack of education.

We need to teach people to think on their own, take decisions. Each day.


This quote was actual at the time of Churchill. Hope it is not now.
