What is programming mantra? This is small advice or [rule of thumb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thumb) that should help write better code. Lets see some examples

1. [Less code is better](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-best-code-is-no-code-at-all/)
2. Prefer composition over inheritance
3. Don't repeat yourself (DRY)

Sometime developers forget what is the purpose of mantras and start follow them blindly without giving a thought on what they actually doing.

Your aim as a developer write good code, not follow mantras. Mantras suppose to help you, not to make decisions instead of you.

### Good code:

 - does what it is suppose to do
 - is readable and maintainable (in one row, because they are the sides of the same coin)

[Here is the story from Sandi Metz](http://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction) which explains how DRY mantra can get you into bad position.
