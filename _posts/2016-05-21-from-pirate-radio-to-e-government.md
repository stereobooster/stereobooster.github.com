At September 2, 1967 pirate radio boss captures North Sea fort - and declares the independent Principality of Sealand.

You can read whole history of Principality of Sealand in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Sealand) or visit [official site](http://www.sealandgov.org/).


### Seastanding

This story served as precedent for [seasteading movement](http://www.seasteading.org/).

> Seasteading is the concept of creating permanent dwellings at sea, called seasteads, outside the territory claimed by any government.

### Country-as-a-service and E-government

> When Seasteading becomes a viable alternative, switching from one government to another would be a matter of sailing to the other without even leaving your house
>
> said Patri Friedman at the first annual Seasteading conference.

This leads us to [country as a service idea](http://www.fse.guru/country-as-a-service). This is ambitious idea, theoretical though.

The most close thing so far is [E-citizenship in Estonia](http://uk.businessinsider.com/interview-with-estonia-cio-taavi-kotka-2016-4) and [E-government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-government) services they are providing.

To be continued.
