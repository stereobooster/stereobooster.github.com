>I think the lack of reusability comes in object-oriented languages, not functional languages. Because the problem with object-oriented languages is they’ve got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. **You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle**.

The actor model is one of the basic ideas behind Erlang [citation required]. SmallTalk is first OOP language, (or second if you count Simula). Alan Kay coined term OOP. I saw a paper where Carl Hewitt explicitly stated that Actor model was inspired by SmallTalk, but I can not find it at the moment.
