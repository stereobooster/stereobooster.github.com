## The 7 stages of naming

Stages taken from ["Good naming is a process, not a single step"](http://arlobelshee.com/good-naming-is-a-process-not-a-single-step/).

1. Missing
1. Nonsense
1. Honest
1. Honest and Complete
1. Does the Right Thing
1. Intent
1. Domain Abstraction

Reminds me 5 of stages in [KÃ¼bler-Ross model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model).
