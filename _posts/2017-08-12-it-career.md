## Cracking coding questions

- Cheat: google for "name of company interview questions". Most likely you will get page on glassdoor.com
- There are dedicated [books](https://github.com/careercup/ctci
) and [videos](https://vimeo.com/114005872
) on the subject, but I would recommend just read good book on algorithms
- The smaller company the wider and more practical skills they are looking for. Bigger company will look for theoretical basis, which is most likely will be checked with whiteboard interview and tricky questions
