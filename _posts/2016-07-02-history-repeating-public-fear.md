I wanted to compare public fear of GMO with public fear of vaccination in early periods of [smallpox vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox_vaccine) development. But it appears that it wasn't so irrational fear: there were death accidents and other negative consequences in early stages of research. My initial purpose was to show, that fear of GMO is irrational, but my approach was wrong.

I'm trying to be scientific and objective. Still sometimes I fail and use [logic fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies). [Errare humanum est](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_phrases_(E)).

This meant to be series of "history repeating" posts: to show recurring patterns in history.

In case of smallpox vaccination, experimentation was done before there was strong scientific theory developed. There were errors. So caricature by James Gillray depicting the early controversy surrounding Jenner's vaccination theory had some ground behind it. While anti GMO-poster simply using public fear without any background or research.
