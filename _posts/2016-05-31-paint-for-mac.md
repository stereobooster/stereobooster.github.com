I believe all new Mac users have been asking the same question. This is just super strange that there is no simple, free image editor for Mac OS. Here is roundup of all options.


## Free

### [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/)

Good but too heavy for simple image editing. First thing I done after setup is changed it look to be [more like Photoshop](http://lifehacker.com/how-to-make-the-gimp-work-more-like-photoshop-1551318983)

### Built-in Preview app

Can do `crop` and some other primitive operations. Can't place text.

### [Acorn](http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/)

Looks promising. Haven't tried it yet.

### Other not usable options

- [pinta](https://pinta-project.com/pintaproject/pinta/)
- [paintbrush](http://paintbrush.sourceforge.net/)
- [seashore](http://seashore.sourceforge.net/The_Seashore_Project/About.html)
- [pixlr](https://pixlr.com/editor/)
